            "text": "Arduino is an open-source prototyping platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. It is like the brain of a project.\n\n\nBecause it is so flexible and open source, Arduino is the best solution if you are interested in creating interactive objects or environments no matter you are artists, designers or hobbyists.\n\n\nOne of Seeed Studio\u2019s motto is \u201cGrow the Difference\u201d, which has now become part of the culture of the company. This is not just reflected from what we are doing in popularizing open source culture, but also from our products. Ever since the company funded, we are continuously creating our own open platform to differentiate from the existing one.\n\n\nHere at  Seeed, you can find not only Arduino boardssuch such as Arduino Nano and Arduino Mega, but also many boards that drived fom Arduino such as Seeeduino, a joint effort by Seeed Studio and Arduino. Seeeduino is compatible with Arduino while has more powerful functions and lower price. To start with, you can try the latest version Seeeduino V4.2 or Seeeduino Mega that corresponding to Arduino Mega.\n\n\nProduct  List\n\uf0c1\n\n\n\n\nHere is the list of the Seeeduino Boards you can find in the Seeed WiKi.

It can be used as display device or sketch pad.Compared with the previous version, 2.8``TFT Touch Shield V1.0, we replaced the screen driver with a more professional chip, ILI9341 driver, providing different pin-saving SPI communication without sacrificing the data transmitting speed. Due to the communication method change, programs developed for the original version need modifications before being transplanted to the new version.
